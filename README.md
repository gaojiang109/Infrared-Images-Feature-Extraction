We use Keras with tf backend in the work.


Datasetï¼š
The dataset is too big to upload to github, so I upload it to my cloud disk. Please download it from the link in Dataset.

Code:

Four code files will be upload after the publication of the paper.
Including:

VGG19_13.py is used to train the VGG19 network.

MN1122.py is used to train the MobileNet network.

intermediate_layer_output_MN1122.py is used to extract intermediate layer in MobileNet and calculate EN,AG,and EN variation.

intermediate_layer_output_VGG.py is used to extract intermediate layer in VGG19 and calculate EN,AG,and EN variation.
